This repo is a fun open source program based on [Roundest-mon](https://github.com/TheoBr/roundest-mon) that takes some of what he did a step further by not just using [tRPC](https://trpc.io) for the api, also a third party source of truth.  In Theo's quick example he felt it was faster to just copy all the data to his own database.  I do not have that luxury as there are multiple versions and constantly update meaning I would have to constantly update the database and check for updates and then its a duplicate that I can't be bothered to manage.

## Rebuilding v2 
Took my half baked 6 hour old first version to Theo on stream got ripped apart making dumb architecture decisions and just generally writing shit code so here is attempt two.
